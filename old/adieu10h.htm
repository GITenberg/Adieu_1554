<h1>ADIEU</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>AN OLD MONASTERY</h3>

<p>"Come, deputy of the Centre, forward! Quick step! march! if we
want to<br>
 be in time to dine with the others. Jump, marquis! there,
that's<br>
 right! why, you can skip across a stubble-field like a
deer!"</p>

<p>These words were said by a huntsman peacefully seated at the
edge of<br>
 the forest of Ile-Adam, who was finishing an Havana cigar
while<br>
 waiting for his companion, who had lost his way in the
tangled<br>
 underbrush of the wood. At his side four panting dogs were
watching,<br>
 as he did, the personage he addressed. To understand how
sarcastic<br>
 were these exhortations, repeated at intervals, we should state
that<br>
 the approaching huntsman was a stout little man whose
protuberant<br>
 stomach was the evidence of a truly ministerial "embonpoint." He
was<br>
 struggling painfully across the furrows of a vast wheat-field
recently<br>
 harvested, the stubble of which considerably impeded him; while
to add<br>
 to his other miseries the sun's rays, striking obliquely on his
face,<br>
 collected an abundance of drops of perspiration. Absorbed in
the<br>
 effort to maintain his equilibrium, he leaned, now forward, now
back,<br>
 in close imitation of the pitching of a carriage when
violently<br>
 jolted. The weather looked threatening. Though several spaces of
blue<br>
 sky still parted the thick black clouds toward the horizon, a
flock of<br>
 fleecy vapors were advancing with great rapidity and drawing a
light<br>
 gray curtain from east to west. As the wind was acting only on
the<br>
 upper region of the air, the atmosphere below it pressed down
the hot<br>
 vapors of the earth. Surrounded by masses of tall trees, the
valley<br>
 through which the hunter struggled felt like a furnace. Parched
and<br>
 silent, the forest seemed thirsty. The birds, even the insects,
were<br>
 voiceless; the tree-tops scarcely waved. Those persons who may
still<br>
 remember the summer of 1819 can imagine the woes of the poor
deputy,<br>
 who was struggling along, drenched in sweat, to regain his
mocking<br>
 friend. The latter, while smoking his cigar, had calculated from
the<br>
 position of the sun that it must be about five in the
afternoon.</p>

<p><br>
 "Where the devil are we?" said the stout huntsman, mopping
his<br>
 forehead and leaning against the trunk of a tree nearly opposite
to<br>
 his companion, for he felt unequal to the effort of leaping the
ditch<br>
 between them.</p>

<p>"That's for me to ask you," said the other, laughing, as he
lay among<br>
 the tall brown brake which crowned the bank. Then, throwing the
end of<br>
 his cigar into the ditch, he cried out vehemently: "I swear by
Saint<br>
 Hubert that never again will I trust myself in unknown territory
with<br>
 a statesman, though he be, like you, my dear d'Albon, a college
mate."</p>

<p>"But, Philippe, have you forgotten your French? Or have you
left your<br>
 wits in Siberia?" replied the stout man, casting a sorrowfully
comic<br>
 look at a sign-post about a hundred feet away.</p>

<p>"True, true," cried Philippe, seizing his gun and springing
with a<br>
 bound into the field and thence to the post. "This way, d'Albon,
this<br>
 way," he called back to his friend, pointing to a broad paved
path and<br>
 reading aloud the sign: "'From Baillet to Ile-Adam.' We
shall<br>
 certainly find the path to Cassan, which must branch from this
one<br>
 between here and Ile-Adam."</p>

<p>"You are right, colonel," said Monsieur d'Albon, replacing
upon his<br>
 head the cap with which he had been fanning himself.</p>

<p>"Forward then, my respectable privy councillor," replied
Colonel<br>
 Philippe, whistling to the dogs, who seemed more willing to obey
him<br>
 than the public functionary to whom they belonged.</p>

<p>"Are you aware, marquis," said the jeering soldier, "that we
still<br>
 have six miles to go? That village over there must be
Baillet."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" cried the marquis, "go to Cassan if you must,
but<br>
 you'll go alone. I prefer to stay here, in spite of the coming
storm,<br>
 and wait for the horse you can send me from the chateau. You've
played<br>
 me a trick, Sucy. We were to have had a nice little hunt not far
from<br>
 Cassan, and beaten the coverts I know. Instead of that, you have
kept<br>
 me running like a hare since four o'clock this morning, and all
I've<br>
 had for breakfast is a cup of milk. Now, if you ever have a
petition<br>
 before the Court, I'll make you lose it, however just your
claim."</p>

<p>The poor discouraged huntsman sat down on a stone that
supported the<br>
 signpost, relieved himself of his gun and his gamebag, and
heaved a<br>
 long sigh.</p>

<p>"France! such are thy deputies!" exclaimed Colonel de Sucy,
laughing.<br>
 "Ah! my poor d'Albon, if you had been like me six years in the
wilds<br>
 of Siberia--"</p>

<p>He said no more, but he raised his eyes to heaven as if that
anguish<br>
 were between himself and God.</p>

<p>"Come, march on!" he added. "If you sit still you are
lost."</p>

<p>"How can I, Philippe? It is an old magisterial habit to sit
still. On<br>
 my honor! I'm tired out-- If I had only killed a hare!"</p>

<p>The two men presented a rather rare contrast: the public
functionary<br>
 was forty-two years of age and seemed no more than thirty,
whereas the<br>
 soldier was thirty, and seemed forty at the least. Both wore the
red<br>
 rosette of the officers of the Legion of honor. A few spare
locks of<br>
 black hair mixed with white, like the wing of a magpie, escaped
from<br>
 the colonel's cap, while handsome brown curls adorned the brow
of the<br>
 statesman. One was tall, gallant, high-strung, and the lines of
his<br>
 pallid face showed terrible passions or frightful griefs. The
other<br>
 had a face that was brilliant with health, and jovially worth of
an<br>
 epicurean. Both were deeply sun-burned, and their high gaiters
of<br>
 tanned leather showed signs of the bogs and the thickets they
had just<br>
 come through.</p>

<p>"Come," said Monsieur de Sucy, "let us get on. A short hour's
march,<br>
 and we shall reach Cassan in time for a good dinner."</p>

<p>"It is easy to see you have never loved," replied the
councillor, with<br>
 a look that was pitifully comic; "you are as relentless as
article 304<br>
 of the penal code."</p>

<p>Philippe de Sucy quivered; his broad brow contracted; his face
became<br>
 as sombre as the skies above them. Some memory of awful
bitterness<br>
 distorted for a moment his features, but he said nothing. Like
all<br>
 strong men, he drove down his emotions to the depths of his
heart;<br>
 thinking perhaps, as simple characters are apt to think, that
there<br>
 was something immodest in unveiling griefs when human language
cannot<br>
 render their depths and may only rouse the mockery of those who
do not<br>
 comprehend them. Monsieur d'Albon had one of those delicate
natures<br>
 which divine sorrows, and are instantly sympathetic to the
emotion<br>
 they have involuntarily aroused. He respected his friend's
silence,<br>
 rose, forgot his fatigue, and followed him silently, grieved to
have<br>
 touched a wound that was evidently not healed.</p>

<p>"Some day, my friend," said Philippe, pressing his hand, and
thanking<br>
 him for his mute repentance by a heart-rending look, "I will
relate to<br>
 you my life. To-day I cannot."</p>

<p>They continued their way in silence. When the colonel's pain
seemed<br>
 soothed, the marquis resumed his fatigue; and with the instinct,
or<br>
 rather the will, of a wearied man his eye took in the very
depths of<br>
 the forest; he questioned the tree-tops and examined the
branching<br>
 paths, hoping to discover some dwelling where he could ask<br>
 hospitality. Arriving at a cross-ways, he thought he noticed a
slight<br>
 smoke rising among the trees; he stopped, looked more
attentively, and<br>
 saw, in the midst of a vast copse, the dark-green branches of
several<br>
 pine-trees.</p>

<p>"A house! a house!" he cried, with the joy the sailor feels in
crying<br>
 "Land!"</p>

<p>Then he sprang quickly into the copse, and the colonel, who
had fallen<br>
 into a deep reverie, followed him mechanically.</p>

<p>"I'd rather get an omelet, some cottage bread, and a chair
here," he<br>
 said, "than go to Cassan for sofas, truffles, and Bordeaux."</p>

<p>These words were an exclamation of enthusiasm, elicited from
the<br>
 councillor on catching sight of a wall, the white towers of
which<br>
 glimmered in the distance through the brown masses of the tree
trunks.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! this looks to me as if it had once been a priory,"
cried the<br>
 marquis, as they reached a very old and blackened gate, through
which<br>
 they could see, in the midst of a large park, a building
constructed<br>
 in the style of the monasteries of old. "How those rascals the
monks<br>
 knew how to choose their sites!"</p>

<p>This last exclamation was an expression of surprise and
pleasure at<br>
 the poetical hermitage which met his eyes. The house stood on
the<br>
 slope of the mountain, at the summit of which is the village
of<br>
 Nerville. The great centennial oaks of the forest which
encircled the<br>
 dwelling made the place an absolute solitude. The main
building,<br>
 formerly occupied by the monks, faced south. The park seemed to
have<br>
 about forty acres. Near the house lay a succession of green
meadows,<br>
 charmingly crossed by several clear rivulets, with here and
there a<br>
 piece of water naturally placed without the least apparent
artifice.<br>
 Trees of elegant shape and varied foliage were distributed
about.<br>
 Grottos, cleverly managed, and massive terraces with dilapidated
steps<br>
 and rusty railings, gave a peculiar character to this lone
retreat.<br>
 Art had harmonized her constructions with the picturesque
effects of<br>
 nature. Human passions seemed to die at the feet of those great
trees,<br>
 which guarded this asylum from the tumult of the world as they
shaded<br>
 it from the fires of the sun.</p>

<p><br>
 "How desolate!" thought Monsieur d'Albon, observing the
sombre<br>
 expression which the ancient building gave to the landscape,
gloomy as<br>
 though a curse were on it. It seemed a fatal spot deserted by
man. Ivy<br>
 had stretched its tortuous muscles, covered by its rich green
mantle,<br>
 everywhere. Brown or green, red or yellow mosses and lichen
spread<br>
 their romantic tints on trees and seats and roofs and stones.
The<br>
 crumbling window-casings were hollowed by rain, defaced by time;
the<br>
 balconies were broken, the terraces demolished. Some of the
outside<br>
 shutters hung from a single hinge. The rotten doors seemed
quite<br>
 unable to resist an assailant. Covered with shining tufts of<br>
 mistletoe, the branches of the neglected fruit-trees gave no
sign of<br>
 fruit. Grass grew in the paths. Such ruin and desolation cast a
weird<br>
 poesy on the scene, filling the souls of the spectators with
dreamy<br>
 thoughts. A poet would have stood there long, plunged in a
melancholy<br>
 reverie, admiring this disorder so full of harmony, this
destruction<br>
 which was not without its grace. Suddenly, the brown tiles
shone, the<br>
 mosses glittered, fantastic shadows danced upon the meadows
and<br>
 beneath the trees; fading colors revived; striking contrasts<br>
 developed, the foliage of the trees and shrubs defined itself
more<br>
 clearly in the light. Then--the light went out. The landscape
seemed<br>
 to have spoken, and now was silent, returning to its gloom, or
rather<br>
 to the soft sad tones of an autumnal twilight.</p>

<p>"It is the palace of the Sleeping Beauty," said the marquis,
beginning<br>
 to view the house with the eyes of a land owner. "I wonder to
whom it<br>
 belongs! He must be a stupid fellow not to live in such an
exquisite<br>
 spot."</p>

<p>At that instant a woman sprang from beneath a chestnut-tree
standing<br>
 to the right of the gate, and, without making any noise, passed
before<br>
 the marquis as rapidly as the shadow of a cloud. This vision
made him<br>
 mute with surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, Albon, what's the matter?" asked the colonel.</p>

<p>"I am rubbing my eyes to know if I am asleep or awake,"
replied the<br>
 marquis, with his face close to the iron rails as he tried to
get<br>
 another sight of the phantom.</p>

<p>"She must be beneath that fig-tree," he said, pointing to the
foliage<br>
 of a tree which rose above the wall to the left of the gate.</p>

<p>"She! who?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell?" replied Monsieur d'Albon. "A strange woman
rose up<br>
 there, just before me," he said in a low voice; "she seemed to
come<br>
 from the world of shades rather than from the land of the
living. She<br>
 is so slender, so light, so filmy, she must be diaphanous. Her
face<br>
 was as white as milk; her eyes, her clothes, her hair jet black.
She<br>
 looked at me as she flitted by, and though I may say I'm no
coward,<br>
 that cold immovable look froze the blood in my veins."</p>

<p>"Is she pretty?" asked Philippe.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I could see nothing but the eyes in that
face."</p>

<p>"Well, let the dinner at Cassan go to the devil!" cried the
colonel.<br>
 "Suppose we stay here. I have a sudden childish desire to enter
that<br>
 singular house. Do you see those window-frames painted red, and
the<br>
 red lines on the doors and shutters? Doesn't the place look to
you as<br>
 if it belonged to the devil?--perhaps he inherited it from the
monks.<br>
 Come, let us pursue the black and white lady--forward, march!"
cried<br>
 Philippe, with forced gaiety.</p>

<p>At that instant the two huntsmen heard a cry that was
something like<br>
 that of a mouse caught in a trap. They listened. The rustle of a
few<br>
 shrubs sounded in the silence like the murmur of a breaking
wave. In<br>
 vain they listened for other sounds; the earth was dumb, and
kept the<br>
 secret of those light steps, if, indeed, the unknown woman moved
at<br>
 all.</p>

<p>"It is very singular!" said Philippe, as they skirted the park
wall.</p>

<p>The two friends presently reached a path in the forest which
led to<br>
 the village of Chauvry. After following this path some way
toward the<br>
 main road to Paris, they came to another iron gate which led to
the<br>
 principal facade of the mysterious dwelling. On this side
the<br>
 dilapidation and disorder of the premises had reached their
height.<br>
 Immense cracks furrowed the walls of the house, which was built
on<br>
 three sides of a square. Fragments of tiles and slates lying on
the<br>
 ground, and the dilapidated condition of the roofs, were
evidence of a<br>
 total want of care on the part of the owners. The fruit had
fallen<br>
 from the trees and lay rotting on the ground; a cow was feeding
on the<br>
 lawn and treading down the flowers in the borders, while a
goat<br>
 browsed on the shoots of the vines and munched the unripe
grapes.</p>

<p>"Here all is harmony; the devastation seems organized," said
the<br>
 colonel, pulling the chain of a bell; but the bell was without
a<br>
 clapper.</p>

<p>The huntsmen heard nothing but the curiously sharp noise of a
rusty<br>
 spring. Though very dilapidated, a little door made in the wall
beside<br>
 the iron gates resisted all their efforts to open it.</p>

<p>"Well, well, this is getting to be exciting," said de Sucy to
his<br>
 companion.</p>

<p>"If I were not a magistrate," replied Monsieur d'Albon, "I
should<br>
 think that woman was a witch."</p>

<p>As he said the words, the cow came to the iron gate and pushed
her<br>
 warm muzzle towards them, as if she felt the need of seeing
human<br>
 beings. Then a woman, if that name could be applied to the
indefinable<br>
 being who suddenly issued from a clump of bushes, pulled away
the cow<br>
 by its rope. This woman wore on her head a red handkerchief,
beneath<br>
 which trailed long locks of hair in color and shape like the
flax on a<br>
 distaff. She wore no fichu. A coarse woollen petticoat in black
and<br>
 gray stripes, too short by several inches, exposed her legs. She
might<br>
 have belonged to some tribe of Red-Skins described by Cooper,
for her<br>
 legs, neck, and arms were the color of brick. No ray of
intelligence<br>
 enlivened her vacant face. A few whitish hairs served her
for<br>
 eyebrows; the eyes themselves, of a dull blue, were cold and
wan; and<br>
 her mouth was so formed as to show the teeth, which were
crooked, but<br>
 as white as those of a dog.</p>

<p>"Here, my good woman!" called Monsieur de Sucy.</p>

<p>She came very slowly to the gate, looking with a silly
expression at<br>
 the two huntsmen, the sight of whom brought a forced and painful
smile<br>
 to her face.</p>

<p>"Where are we? Whose house is this? Who are you? Do you belong
here?"</p>

<p>To these questions and several others which the two
friends<br>
 alternately addressed to her, she answered only with guttural
sounds<br>
 that seemed more like the growl of an animal than the voice of a
human<br>
 being.</p>

<p>"She must be deaf and dumb," said the marquis.</p>

<p>"Bons-Hommes!" cried the peasant woman.</p>

<p>"Ah! I see. This is, no doubt, the old monastery of the
Bons-Hommes,"<br>
 said the marquis.</p>

<p>He renewed his questions. But, like a capricious child, the
peasant<br>
 woman colored, played with her wooden shoe, twisted the rope of
the<br>
 cow, which was now feeding peaceably, and looked at the two
hunters,<br>
 examining every part of their clothing; then she yelped,
growled, and<br>
 clucked, but did not speak.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" said Philippe, looking at her fixedly, as
if he<br>
 meant to mesmerize her.</p>

<p>"Genevieve," she said, laughing with a silly air.</p>

<p>"The cow is the most intelligent being we have seen so far,"
said the<br>
 marquis. "I shall fire my gun and see if that will being some
one."</p>

<p>Just as d'Albon raised his gun, the colonel stopped him with
a<br>
 gesture, and pointed to the form of a woman, probably the one
who had<br>
 so keenly piqued his curiosity. At this moment she seemed lost
in the<br>
 deepest meditation, and was coming with slow steps along a
distant<br>
 pathway, so that the two friends had ample time to examine
her.</p>

<p>She was dressed in a ragged gown of black satin. Her long hair
fell in<br>
 masses of curls over her forehead, around her shoulders, and
below her<br>
 waist, serving her for a shawl. Accustomed no doubt to this
disorder,<br>
 she seldom pushed her hair from her forehead; and when she did
so, it<br>
 was with a sudden toss of her head which only for a moment
cleared her<br>
 forehead and eyes from the thick veil. Her gesture, like that of
an<br>
 animal, had a remarkable mechanical precision, the quickness of
which<br>
 seemed wonderful in a woman. The huntsmen were amazed to see
her<br>
 suddenly leap up on the branch of an apple-tree, and sit there
with<br>
 the ease of a bird. She gathered an apple and ate it; then she
dropped<br>
 to the ground with the graceful ease we admire in a squirrel.
Her<br>
 limbs possessed an elasticity which took from every movement
the<br>
 slightest appearance of effort or constraint. She played upon
the<br>
 turf, rolling herself about like a child; then, suddenly, she
flung<br>
 her feet and hands forward, and lay at full length on the grass,
with<br>
 the grace and natural ease of a young cat asleep in the sun.
Thunder<br>
 sounded in the distance, and she turned suddenly, rising on her
hands<br>
 and knees with the rapidity of a dog which hears a coming
footstep.</p>

<p>The effects of this singular attitude was to separate into two
heavy<br>
 masses the volume of her black hair, which now fell on either
side of<br>
 her head, and allowed the two spectators to admire the white
shoulders<br>
 glistening like daisies in a field, and the throat, the
perfection of<br>
 which allowed them to judge of the other beauties of her
figure.</p>

<p>Suddenly she uttered a distressful cry and rose to her feet.
Her<br>
 movements succeeded each other with such airiness and grace that
she<br>
 seemed not a creature of this world but a daughter of the
atmosphere,<br>
 as sung in the poems of Ossian. She ran toward a piece of water,
shook<br>
 one of her legs lightly to cast off her shoe, and began to
dabble her<br>
 foot, white as alabaster, in the current, admiring, perhaps,
the<br>
 undulations she thus produced upon the surface of the water.
Then she<br>
 knelt down at the edge of the stream and amused herself, like a
child,<br>
 in casting in her long tresses and pulling them abruptly out, to
watch<br>
 the shower of drops that glittered down, looking, as the
sunlight<br>
 struck athwart them, like a chaplet of pearls.</p>

<p>"That woman is mad!" cried the marquis.</p>

<p>A hoarse cry, uttered by Genevieve, seemed uttered as a
warning to the<br>
 unknown woman, who turned suddenly, throwing back her hair from
either<br>
 side of her face. At this instant the colonel and Monsieur
d'Albon<br>
 could distinctly see her features; she, herself, perceiving the
two<br>
 friends, sprang to the iron railing with the lightness and
rapidity of<br>
 a deer.</p>

<p>"Adieu!" she said, in a soft, harmonious voice, the melody of
which<br>
 did not convey the slightest feeling or the slightest
thought.</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Albon admired the long lashes of her eyelids, the
blackness<br>
 of her eyebrows, and the dazzling whiteness of a skin devoid of
even<br>
 the faintest tinge of color. Tiny blue veins alone broke the<br>
 uniformity of its pure white tones. When the marquis turned to
his<br>
 friend as if to share with him his amazement at the sight of
this<br>
 singular creature, he found him stretched on the ground as if
dead.<br>
 D'Albon fired his gun in the air to summon assistance, crying
out<br>
 "Help! help!" and then endeavored to revive the colonel. At the
sound<br>
 of the shot, the unknown woman, who had hitherto stood
motionless,<br>
 fled away with the rapidity of an arrow, uttering cries of fear
like a<br>
 wounded animal, and running hither and thither about the meadow
with<br>
 every sign of the greatest terror.</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Albon, hearing the rumbling of a carriage on the
high-road<br>
 to Ile-Adam, waved his handkerchief and shouted to its occupants
for<br>
 assistance. The carriage was immediately driven up to the
old<br>
 monastery, and the marquis recognized his neighbors, Monsieur
and<br>
 Madame de Granville, who at once gave up their carriage to the
service<br>
 of the two gentlemen. Madame de Granville had with her, by
chance, a<br>
 bottle of salts, which revived the colonel for a moment. When
he<br>
 opened his eyes he turned them to the meadow, where the unknown
woman<br>
 was still running and uttering her distressing cries. A
smothered<br>
 exclamation escaped him, which seemed to express a sense of
horror;<br>
 then he closed his eyes again, and made a gesture as if to
implore his<br>
 friend to remove him from that sight.</p>

<p>Monsieur and Madame de Granville placed their carriage
entirely at the<br>
 disposal of the marquis, assuring him courteously that they
would like<br>
 to continue their way on foot.</p>

<p>"Who is that lady?" asked the marquis, signing toward the
unknown<br>
 woman.</p>

<p>"I believe she comes from Moulins," replied Monsieur de
Granville.<br>
 "She is the Comtesse de Vandieres, and they say she is mad; but
as she<br>
 has only been here two months I will not vouch for the truth of
these<br>
 hearsays."</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Albon thanked his friends, and placing the colonel
in the<br>
 carriage, started with him for Cassan.</p>

<p>"It is she!" cried Philippe, recovering his senses.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" asked d'Albon.</p>

<p>"Stephanie. Ah, dead and living, living and mad! I fancied I
was<br>
 dying."</p>

<p>The prudent marquis, appreciating the gravity of the crisis
through<br>
 which his friend was passing, was careful not to question or
excite<br>
 him; he was only anxious to reach the chateau, for the change
which<br>
 had taken place in the colonel's features, in fact in his
whole<br>
 person, made him fear for his friend's reason. As soon,
therefore, as<br>
 the carriage had reached the main street of Ile-Adam, he
dispatched<br>
 the footman to the village doctor, so that the colonel was no
sooner<br>
 fairly in his bed at the chateau than the physician was beside
him.</p>

<p>"If monsieur had not been many hours without food the shock
would have<br>
 killed him," said the doctor.</p>

<p>After naming the first precautions, the doctor left the room,
to<br>
 prepare, himself, a calming potion. The next day, Monsieur de
Sucy was<br>
 better, but the doctor still watched him carefully.</p>

<p>"I will admit to you, monsieur le marquis," he said, "that I
have<br>
 feared some affection of the brain. Monsieur de Sucy has
received a<br>
 violent shock; his passions are strong; but, in him, the first
blow<br>
 decides all. To-morrow he may be entirely out of danger."</p>

<p>The doctor was not mistaken; and the following day he allowed
the<br>
 marquis to see his friend.</p>

<p>"My dear d'Albon," said Philippe, pressing his hand, "I am
going to<br>
 ask a kindness of you. Go to the Bons-Hommes, and find out all
you can<br>
 of the lady we saw there; and return to me as quickly as you
can; I<br>
 shall count the minutes."</p>

<p>Monsieur d'Albon mounted his horse at once, and galloped to
the old<br>
 abbey. When he arrived there, he saw before the iron gate a
tall,<br>
 spare man with a very kindly face, who answered in the
affirmative<br>
 when asked if he lived there. Monsieur d'Albon then informed him
of<br>
 the reasons for his visit.</p>

<p>"What! monsieur," said the other, "was it you who fired that
fatal<br>
 shot? You very nearly killed my poor patient."</p>

<p>"But, monsieur, I fired in the air."</p>

<p>"You would have done the countess less harm had you fired at
her."</p>

<p>"Then we must not reproach each other, monsieur, for the sight
of the<br>
 countess has almost killed my friend, Monsieur de Sucy."</p>

<p>"Heavens! can you mean Baron Philippe de Sucy?" cried the
doctor,<br>
 clasping his hands. "Did he go to Russia; was he at the passage
of the<br>
 Beresina?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied d'Albon, "he was captured by the Cossacks and
kept for<br>
 five years in Siberia; he recovered his liberty a few months
ago."</p>

<p>"Come in, monsieur," said the master of the house, leading the
marquis<br>
 into a room on the lower floor where everything bore the marks
of<br>
 capricious destruction. The silken curtains beside the windows
were<br>
 torn, while those of muslin remained intact.</p>

<p>"You see," said the tall old man, as they entered, "the
ravages<br>
 committed by that dear creature, to whom I devote myself. She is
my<br>
 niece; in spite of the impotence of my art, I hope some day to
restore<br>
 her reason by attempting a method which can only be
employed,<br>
 unfortunately, by very rich people."</p>

<p>Then, like all persons living in solitude who are afflicted
with an<br>
 ever present and ever renewed grief, he related to the marquis
at<br>
 length the following narrative, which is here condensed, and
relieved<br>
 of the many digressions made by both the narrator and the
listener.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE PASSAGE OF THE BERESINA</h3>

<p>Marechal Victor, when he started, about nine at night, from
the<br>
 heights of Studzianka, which he had defended, as the rear-guard
of the<br>
 retreating army, during the whole day of November 28th, 1812,
left a<br>
 thousand men behind him, with orders to protect to the last
possible<br>
 moment whichever of the two bridges across the Beresina might
still<br>
 exist. This rear-guard had devoted itself to the task of saving
a<br>
 frightful multitude of stragglers overcome by the cold, who<br>
 obstinately refused to leave the bivouacs of the army. The
heroism of<br>
 this generous troop proved useless. The stragglers who flocked
in<br>
 masses to the banks of the Beresina found there, unhappily, an
immense<br>
 number of carriages, caissons, and articles of all kinds which
the<br>
 army had been forced to abandon when effecting its passage of
the<br>
 river on the 27th and 28th of November. Heirs to such
unlooked-for<br>
 riches, the unfortunate men, stupid with cold, took up their
abode in<br>
 the deserted bivouacs, broke up the material which they found
there to<br>
 build themselves cabins, made fuel of everything that came to
hand,<br>
 cut up the frozen carcasses of the horses for food, tore the
cloth and<br>
 the curtains from the carriages for coverlets, and went to
sleep,<br>
 instead of continuing their way and crossing quietly during the
night<br>
 that cruel Beresina, which an incredible fatality had already
made so<br>
 destructive to the army.</p>

<p><br>
 The apathy of these poor soldiers can only be conceived by those
who<br>
 remember to have crossed vast deserts of snow without other<br>
 perspective than a snow horizon, without other drink than
snow,<br>
 without other bed than snow, without other food than snow or a
few<br>
 frozen beet-roots, a few handfuls of flour, or a little
horseflesh.<br>
 Dying of hunger, thirst, fatigue, and want of sleep, these<br>
 unfortunates reached a shore where they saw before them
wood,<br>
 provisions, innumerable camp equipages, and carriages,--in short
a<br>
 whole town at their service. The village of Studzianka had been
wholly<br>
 taken to pieces and conveyed from the heights on which it stood
to the<br>
 plain. However forlorn and dangerous that refuge might be,
its<br>
 miseries and its perils only courted men who had lately seen
nothing<br>
 before them but the awful deserts of Russia. It was, in fact, a
vast<br>
 asylum which had an existence of twenty-four hours only.</p>

<p>Utter lassitude, and the sense of unexpected comfort, made
that mass<br>
 of men inaccessible to every thought but that of rest. Though
the<br>
 artillery of the left wing of the Russians kept up a steady fire
on<br>
 this mass,--visible like a stain now black, now flaming, in the
midst<br>
 of the trackless snow,--this shot and shell seemed to the
torpid<br>
 creatures only one inconvenience the more. It was like a
thunderstorm,<br>
 despised by all because the lightning strikes so few; the balls
struck<br>
 only here and there, the dying, the sick, the dead
sometimes!<br>
 Stragglers arrived in groups continually; but once here
those<br>
 perambulating corpses separated; each begged for himself a place
near<br>
 a fire; repulsed repeatedly, they met again, to obtain by force
the<br>
 hospitality already refused to them. Deaf to the voice of some
of<br>
 their officers, who warned them of probable destruction on the
morrow,<br>
 they spent the amount of courage necessary to cross the river
in<br>
 building that asylum of a night, in making one meal that
they<br>
 themselves doomed to be their last. The death that awaited them
they<br>
 considered no evil, provided they could have that one night's
sleep.<br>
 They thought nothing evil but hunger, thirst, and cold. When
there was<br>
 no more wood or food or fire, horrible struggles took place
between<br>
 fresh-comers and the rich who possessed a shelter. The
weakest<br>
 succumbed.</p>

<p>At last there came a moment when a number, pursued by the
Russians,<br>
 found only snow on which to bivouac, and these lay down to rise
no<br>
 more. Insensibly this mass of almost annihilated beings became
so<br>
 compact, so deaf, so torpid, so happy perhaps, that Marechal
Victor,<br>
 who had been their heroic defender by holding twenty thousand
Russians<br>
 under Wittgenstein at bay, was forced to open a passage by main
force<br>
 through this forest of men in order to cross the Beresina with
five<br>
 thousand gallant fellows whom he was taking to the emperor.
The<br>
 unfortunate malingerers allowed themselves to be crushed rather
than<br>
 stir; they perished in silence, smiling at their extinguished
fires,<br>
 without a thought of France.</p>

<p>It was not until ten o'clock that night that Marechal Victor
reached<br>
 the bank of the river. Before crossing the bridge which led to
Zembin,<br>
 he confided the fate of his own rear-guard now left in
Studzianka to<br>
 Eble, the savior of all those who survived the calamities of
the<br>
 Beresina. It was towards midnight when this great general,
followed by<br>
 one brave officer, left the cabin he occupied near the bridge,
and<br>
 studied the spectacle of that improvised camp placed between the
bank<br>
 of the river and Studzianka. The Russian cannon had ceased to
thunder.<br>
 Innumerable fires, which, amid that trackless waste of snow,
burned<br>
 pale and scarcely sent out any gleams, illumined here and there
by<br>
 sudden flashes forms and faces that were barely human. Thirty
thousand<br>
 poor wretches, belonging to all nations, from whom Napoleon
had<br>
 recruited his Russian army, were trifling away their lives
with<br>
 brutish indifference.</p>

<p>"Let us save them!" said General Eble to the officer who
accompanied<br>
 him. "To-morrow morning the Russians will be masters of
Studzianka. We<br>
 must burn the bridge the moment they appear. Therefore, my
friend,<br>
 take your courage in your hand! Go to the heights. Tell
General<br>
 Fournier he has barely time to evacuate his position, force a
way<br>
 through this crowd, and cross the bridge. When you have seen him
in<br>
 motion follow him. Find men you can trust, and the moment
Fournier had<br>
 crossed the bridge, burn, without pity, huts, equipages,
caissons,<br>
 carriages,--EVERYTHING! Drive that mass of men to the bridge.
Compel<br>
 all that has two legs to get to the other side of the river.
The<br>
 burning of everything--EVERYTHING--is now our last resource.
If<br>
 Berthier had let me destroy those damned camp equipages, this
river<br>
 would swallow only my poor pontoniers, those fifty heroes who
will<br>
 save the army, but who themselves will be forgotten."</p>

<p>The general laid his hand on his forehead and was silent. He
felt that<br>
 Poland would be his grave, and that no voice would rise to do
justice<br>
 to those noble men who stood in the water, the icy water of
Beresina,<br>
 to destroy the buttresses of the bridges. One alone of those
heroes<br>
 still lives--or, to speak more correctly, suffers--in a
village,<br>
 totally ignored.</p>

<p>The aide-de-camp started. Hardly had this generous officer
gone a<br>
 hundred yards towards Studzianka than General Eble wakened a
number of<br>
 his weary pontoniers, and began the work,--the charitable work
of<br>
 burning the bivouacs set up about the bridge, and forcing
the<br>
 sleepers, thus dislodged, to cross the river.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the young aide-de-camp reached, not without
difficulty, the<br>
 only wooden house still left standing in Studzianka.</p>

<p>"This barrack seems pretty full, comrade," he said to a man
whom he<br>
 saw by the doorway.</p>

<p>"If you can get in you'll be a clever trooper," replied the
officer,<br>
 without turning his head or ceasing to slice off with his sabre
the<br>
 bark of the logs of which the house was built.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Philippe?" said the aide-de-camp, recognizing a
friend<br>
 by the tones of his voice.</p>

<p>"Yes. Ha, ha! is it you, old fellow?" replied Monsieur de
Sucy,<br>
 looking at the aide-de-camp, who, like himself, was only
twenty-three<br>
 years of age. "I thought you were the other side of that cursed
river.<br>
 What are you here for? Have you brought cakes and wine for
our<br>
 dessert? You'll be welcome," and he went on slicing off the
bark,<br>
 which he gave as a sort of provender to his horse.</p>

<p>"I am looking for your commander to tell him, from General
Eble, to<br>
 make for Zembin. You'll have barely enough time to get through
that<br>
 crowd of men below. I am going presently to set fire to their
camp and<br>
 force them to march."</p>

<p>"You warm me up--almost! That news makes me perspire. I have
two<br>
 friends I MUST save. Ah! without those two to cling to me, I
should be<br>
 dead already. It is for them that I feed my horse and don't
eat<br>
 myself. Have you any food,--a mere crust? It is thirty hours
since<br>
 anything has gone into my stomach, and yet I have fought like a
madman<br>
 --just to keep a little warmth and courage in me."</p>

<p>"Poor Philippe, I have nothing--nothing! But where's your
general,--in<br>
 this house?"</p>

<p>"No, don't go there; the place is full of wounded. Go up the
street;<br>
 you'll find on your left a sort of pig-pen; the general is
there.<br>
 Good-bye, old fellow. If we ever dance a trenis on a Paris
floor--"</p>

<p>He did not end his sentence; the north wind blew at that
moment with<br>
 such ferocity that the aide-de-camp hurried on to escape being
frozen,<br>
 and the lips of Major de Sucy stiffened. Silence reigned, broken
only<br>
 by the moans which came from the house, and the dull sound made
by the<br>
 major's horse as it chewed in a fury of hunger the icy bark of
the<br>
 trees with which the house was built. Monsieur de Sucy replaced
his<br>
 sabre in its scabbard, took the bridle of the precious horse he
had<br>
 hitherto been able to preserve, and led it, in spite of the
animal's<br>
 resistance, from the wretched fodder it appeared to think
excellent.</p>

<p>"We'll start, Bichette, we'll start! There's none but you, my
beauty,<br>
 who can save Stephanie. Ha! by and bye you and I may be able to
rest--<br>
 and die," he added.</p>

<p>Philippe, wrapped in a fur pelisse, to which he owed his
preservation<br>
 and his energy, began to run, striking his feet hard upon the
frozen<br>
 snow to keep them warm. Scarcely had he gone a few hundred yards
from<br>
 the village than he saw a blaze in the direction of the place
where,<br>
 since morning, he had left his carriage in charge of his
former<br>
 orderly, an old soldier. Horrible anxiety laid hold of him. Like
all<br>
 others who were controlled during this fatal retreat by some
powerful<br>
 sentiment, he found a strength to save his friends which he
could not<br>
 have put forth to save himself.</p>

<p>Presently he reached a slight declivity at the foot of which,
in a<br>
 spot sheltered from the enemy's balls, he had stationed the
carriage,<br>
 containing a young woman, the companion of his childhood, the
being<br>
 most dear to him on earth. At a few steps distant from the
vehicle he<br>
 now found a company of some thirty stragglers collected around
an<br>
 immense fire, which they were feeding with planks, caisson
covers,<br>
 wheels, and broken carriages. These soldiers were, no doubt, the
last<br>
 comers of that crowd who, from the base of the hill of
Studzianka to<br>
 the fatal river, formed an ocean of heads intermingled with
fires and<br>
 huts,--a living sea, swayed by motions that were almost
imperceptible,<br>
 and giving forth a murmuring sound that rose at times to
frightful<br>
 outbursts. Driven by famine and despair, these poor wretches
must have<br>
 rifled the carriage before de Sucy reached it. The old general
and his<br>
 young wife, whom he had left lying in piles of clothes and
wrapped in<br>
 mantles and pelisses, were now on the snow, crouching before the
fire.<br>
 One door of the carriage was already torn off.</p>

<p>No sooner did the men about the fire hear the tread of the
major's<br>
 horse than a hoarse cry, the cry of famine, arose,--</p>

<p>"A horse! a horse!"</p>

<p>Those voices formed but one voice.</p>

<p>"Back! back! look out for yourself!" cried two or three
soldiers,<br>
 aiming at the mare. Philippe threw himself before his animal,
crying<br>
 out,--</p>

<p>"You villains! I'll throw you into your own fire. There are
plenty of<br>
 dead horses up there. Go and fetch them."</p>

<p>"Isn't he a joker, that officer! One, two--get out of the
way," cried<br>
 a colossal grenadier. "No, you won't, hey! Well, as you please,
then."</p>

<p>A woman's cry rose higher than the report of the musket.
Philippe<br>
 fortunately was not touched, but Bichette, mortally wounded,
was<br>
 struggling in the throes of death. Three men darted forward
and<br>
 dispatched her with their bayonets.</p>

<p>"Cannibals!" cried Philippe, "let me at any rate take the
horse-cloth<br>
 and my pistols."</p>

<p>"Pistols, yes," replied the grenadier. "But as for that
horse-cloth,<br>
 no! here's a poor fellow afoot, with nothing in his stomach for
two<br>
 days, and shivering in his rags. It is our general."</p>

<p>Philippe kept silence as he looked at the man, whose boots
were worn<br>
 out, his trousers torn in a dozen places, while nothing but a
ragged<br>
 fatigue-cap covered with ice was on his head. He hastened,
however, to<br>
 take his pistols. Five men dragged the mare to the fire, and cut
her<br>
 up with the dexterity of a Parisian butcher. The pieces were
instantly<br>
 seized and flung upon the embers.</p>

<p>The major went up to the young woman, who had uttered a cry
on<br>
 recognizing him. He found her motionless, seated on a cushion
beside<br>
 the fire. She looked at him silently, without smiling. Philippe
then<br>
 saw the soldier to whom he had confided the carriage; the man
was<br>
 wounded. Overcome by numbers, he had been forced to yield to
the<br>
 malingerers who attacked him; and, like the dog who defended to
the<br>
 last possible moment his master's dinner, he had taken his share
of<br>
 the booty, and was now sitting beside the fire, wrapped in a
white<br>
 sheet by way of cloak, and turning carefully on the embers a
slice of<br>
 the mare. Philippe saw upon his face the joy these preparations
gave<br>
 him. The Comte de Vandieres, who, for the last few days, had
fallen<br>
 into a state of second childhood, was seated on a cushion beside
his<br>
 wife, looking fixedly at the fire, which was beginning to thaw
his<br>
 torpid limbs. He had shown no emotion of any kind, either at<br>
 Philippe's danger, or at the fight which ended in the pillage of
the<br>
 carriage and their expulsion from it.</p>

<p>At first de Sucy took the hand of the young countess, as if to
show<br>
 her his affection, and the grief he felt at seeing her reduced
to such<br>
 utter misery; then he grew silent; seated beside her on a heap
of snow<br>
 which was turning into a rivulet as it melted, he yielded
himself up<br>
 to the happiness of being warm, forgetting their peril,
forgetting all<br>
 things. His face assumed, in spite of himself, an expression of
almost<br>
 stupid joy, and he waited with impatience until the fragment of
the<br>
 mare given to his orderly was cooked. The smell of the roasting
flesh<br>
 increased his hunger, and his hunger silenced his heart, his
courage,<br>
 and his love. He looked, without anger, at the results of the
pillage<br>
 of his carriage. All the men seated around the fire had shared
his<br>
 blankets, cushions, pelisses, robes, also the clothing of the
Comte<br>
 and Comtesse de Vandieres and his own. Philippe looked about him
to<br>
 see if there was anything left in or near the vehicle that was
worth<br>
 saving. By the light of the flames he saw gold and diamonds and
plate<br>
 scattered everywhere, no one having thought it worth his while
to take<br>
 any.</p>

<p>Each of the individuals collected by chance around this
fire<br>
 maintained a silence that was almost horrible, and did nothing
but<br>
 what he judged necessary for his own welfare. Their misery was
even<br>
 grotesque. Faces, discolored by cold, were covered with a layer
of<br>
 mud, on which tears had made a furrow from the eyes to the
beard,<br>
 showing the thickness of that miry mask. The filth of their
long<br>
 beards made these men still more repulsive. Some were wrapped in
the<br>
 countess's shawls, others wore the trappings of horses and
muddy<br>
 saddlecloths, or masses of rags from which the hoar-frost hung;
some<br>
 had a boot on one leg and a shoe on the other; in fact, there
were<br>
 none whose costume did not present some laughable singularity.
But in<br>
 presence of such amusing sights the men themselves were grave
and<br>
 gloomy. The silence was broken only by the snapping of the wood,
the<br>
 crackling of the flames, the distant murmur of the camps, and
the<br>
 blows of the sabre given to what remained of Bichette in search
of her<br>
 tenderest morsels. A few miserable creatures, perhaps more weary
than<br>
 the rest, were sleeping; when one of their number rolled into
the fire<br>
 no one attempted to help him out. These stern logicians argued
that if<br>
 he were not dead his burns would warn him to find a safer place.
If<br>
 the poor wretch waked in the flames and perished, no one cared.
Two or<br>
 three soldiers looked at each other to justify their own
indifference<br>
 by that of others. Twice this scene had taken place before the
eyes of<br>
 the countess, who said nothing. When the various pieces of
Bichette,<br>
 placed here and there upon the embers, were sufficiently
broiled, each<br>
 man satisfied his hunger with the gluttony that disgusts us when
we<br>
 see it in animals.</p>

<p>"This is the first time I ever saw thirty infantrymen on one
horse,"<br>
 cried the grenadier who had shot the mare.</p>

<p>It was the only jest made that night which proved the
national<br>
 character.</p>

<p>Soon the great number of these poor soldiers wrapped
themselves in<br>
 what they could find and lay down on planks, or whatever would
keep<br>
 them from contact with the snow, and slept, heedless of the
morrow.<br>
 When the major was warm, and his hunger appeased, an invincible
desire<br>
 to sleep weighed down his eyelids. During the short moment of
his<br>
 struggle against that desire he looked at the young woman, who
had<br>
 turned her face to the fire and was now asleep, leaving her
closed<br>
 eyes and a portion of her forehead exposed to sight. She was
wrapped<br>
 in a furred pelisse and a heavy dragoon's cloak; her head rested
on a<br>
 pillow stained with blood; an astrakhan hood, kept in place by
a<br>
 handkerchief knotted round her neck, preserved her face from the
cold<br>
 as much as possible. Her feet were wrapped in the cloak. Thus
rolled<br>
 into a bundle, as it were, she looked like nothing at all. Was
she the<br>
 last of the "vivandieres"? Was she a charming woman, the glory
of a<br>
 lover, the queen of Parisian salons? Alas! even the eye of her
most<br>
 devoted friend could trace no sign of anything feminine in that
mass<br>
 of rags and tatters. Love had succumbed to cold in the heart of
a<br>
 woman!</p>

<p>Through the thick veils of irresistible sleep, the major soon
saw the<br>
 husband and wife as mere points or formless objects. The flames
of the<br>
 fire, those outstretched figures, the relentless cold, waiting,
not<br>
 three feet distant from that fugitive heat, became all a dream.
One<br>
 importunate thought terrified Philippe:</p>

<p>"If I sleep, we shall all die; I will not sleep," he said to
himself.</p>

<p>And yet he slept.</p>

<p>A terrible clamor and an explosion awoke him an hour later.
The sense<br>
 of his duty, the peril of his friend, fell suddenly on his
heart. He<br>
 uttered a cry that was like a roar. He and his orderly were
alone<br>
 afoot. A sea of fire lay before them in the darkness of the
night,<br>
 licking up the cabins and the bivouacs; cries of despair, howls,
and<br>
 imprecations reached their ears; they saw against the flames
thousands<br>
 of human beings with agonized or furious faces. In the midst of
that<br>
 hell, a column of soldiers was forcing its way to the bridge,
between<br>
 two hedges of dead bodies.</p>

<p>"It is the retreat of the rear-guard!" cried the major. "All
hope is<br>
 gone!"</p>

<p>"I have saved your carriage, Philippe," said a friendly
voice.</p>

<p>Turning round, de Sucy recognized the young aide-de-camp in
the<br>
 flaring of the flames.</p>

<p>"Ah! all is lost!" replied the major, "they have eaten my
horse; and<br>
 how can I make this stupid general and his wife walk?"</p>

<p>"Take a brand from the fire and threaten them."</p>

<p>"Threaten the countess!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said the aide-de-camp, "I have scarcely time to
get across<br>
 that fatal river--and I MUST; I have a mother in France. What a
night!<br>
 These poor wretches prefer to lie here in the snow; half will
allow<br>
 themselves to perish in those flames rather than rise and move
on. It<br>
 is four o'clock, Philippe! In two hours the Russians will begin
to<br>
 move. I assure you you will again see the Beresina choked
with<br>
 corpses. Philippe! think of yourself! You have no horses, you
cannot<br>
 carry the countess in your arms. Come--come with me!" he
said<br>
 urgently, pulling de Sucy by the arm.</p>

<p>"My friend! abandon Stephanie!"</p>

<p>De Sucy seized the countess, made her stand upright, shook her
with<br>
 the roughness of a despairing man, and compelled her to wake up.
She<br>
 looked at him with fixed, dead eyes.</p>

<p>"You must walk, Stephanie, or we shall all die here."</p>

<p>For all answer the countess tried to drop again upon the snow
and<br>
 sleep. The aide-de-camp seized a brand from the fire and waved
it in<br>
 her face.</p>

<p>"We will save her in spite of herself!" cried Philippe,
lifting the<br>
 countess and placing her in the carriage.</p>

<p>He returned to implore the help of his friend. Together they
lifted<br>
 the old general, without knowing whether he were dead or alive,
and<br>
 put him beside his wife. The major then rolled over the men who
were<br>
 sleeping on his blankets, which he tossed into the carriage,
together<br>
 with some roasted fragments of his mare.</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do?" asked the aide-de-camp.</p>

<p>"Drag them."</p>

<p>"You are crazy."</p>

<p>"True," said Philippe, crossing his arms in despair.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he was seized by a last despairing thought.</p>

<p>"To you," he said, grasping the sound arm of his orderly, "I
confide<br>
 her for one hour. Remember that you must die sooner than let any
one<br>
 approach her."</p>

<p>The major then snatched up the countess's diamonds, held them
in one<br>
 hand, drew his sabre with the other, and began to strike with
the flat<br>
 of its blade such of the sleepers as he thought the most
intrepid. He<br>
 succeeded in awaking the colossal grenadier, and two other men
whose<br>
 rank it was impossible to tell.</p>

<p>"We are done for!" he said.</p>

<p>"I know it," said the grenadier, "but I don't care."</p>

<p>"Well, death for death, wouldn't you rather sell your life for
a<br>
 pretty woman, and take your chances of seeing France?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather sleep," said a man, rolling over on the snow, "and
if you<br>
 trouble me again, I'll stick my bayonet into your stomach."</p>

<p>"What is the business, my colonel?" said the grenadier. "That
man is<br>
 drunk; he's a Parisian; he likes his ease."</p>

<p>"That is yours, my brave grenadier," cried the major, offering
him a<br>
 string of diamonds, "if you will follow me and fight like a
madman.<br>
 The Russians are ten minutes' march from here; they have horses;
we<br>
 are going up to their first battery for a pair."</p>

<p>"But the sentinels?"</p>

<p>"One of us three--" he interrupted himself, and turned to the
aide-de-<br>
 camp. "You will come, Hippolyte, won't you?"</p>

<p>Hippolyte nodded.</p>

<p>"One of us," continued the major, "will take care of the
sentinel.<br>
 Besides, perhaps they are asleep too, those cursed
Russians."</p>

<p>"Forward! major, you're a brave one! But you'll give me a lift
on your<br>
 carriage?" said the grenadier.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you don't leave your skin up there-- If I fall,
Hippolyte,<br>
 and you, grenadier, promise me to do your utmost to save the<br>
 countess."</p>

<p>"Agreed!" cried the grenadier.</p>

<p>They started for the Russian lines, toward one of the
batteries which<br>
 had so decimated the hapless wretches lying on the banks of the
river.<br>
 A few moments later, the gallop of two horses echoed over the
snow,<br>
 and the wakened artillery men poured out a volley which ranged
above<br>
 the heads of the sleeping men. The pace of the horses was so
fleet<br>
 that their steps resounded like the blows of a blacksmith on
his<br>
 anvil. The generous aide-de-camp was killed. The athletic
grenadier<br>
 was safe and sound. Philippe in defending Hippolyte had received
a<br>
 bayonet in his shoulder; but he clung to his horse's mane, and
clasped<br>
 him so tightly with his knees that the animal was held as in a
vice.</p>

<p>"God be praised!" cried the major, finding his orderly
untouched, and<br>
 the carriage in its place.</p>

<p>"If you are just, my officer, you will get me the cross for
this,"<br>
 said the man. "We've played a fine game of guns and sabres here,
I can<br>
 tell you."</p>

<p>"We have done nothing yet-- Harness the horses. Take these
ropes."</p>

<p>"They are not long enough."</p>

<p>"Grenadier, turn over those sleepers, and take their shawls
and linen,<br>
 to eke out."</p>

<p>"Tiens! that's one dead," said the grenadier, stripping the
first man<br>
 he came to. "Bless me! what a joke, they are all dead!"</p>

<p>"All?"</p>

<p>"Yes, all; seems as if horse-meat must be indigestible if
eaten with<br>
 snow."</p>

<p>The words made Philippe tremble. The cold was increasing.</p>

<p>"My God! to lose the woman I have saved a dozen times!"</p>

<p>The major shook the countess.</p>

<p>"Stephanie! Stephanie!"</p>

<p>The young woman opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"Madame! we are saved."</p>

<p>"Saved!" she repeated, sinking down again.</p>

<p>The horses were harnessed as best they could. The major,
holding his<br>
 sabre in his well hand, with his pistols in his belt, gathered
up the<br>
 reins with the other hand and mounted one horse while the
grenadier<br>
 mounted the other. The orderly, whose feet were frozen, was
thrown<br>
 inside the carriage, across the general and the countess.
Excited by<br>
 pricks from a sabre, the horses drew the carriage rapidly, with
a sort<br>
 of fury, to the plain, where innumerable obstacles awaited it.
It was<br>
 impossible to force a way without danger of crushing the
sleeping men,<br>
 women, and even children, who refused to move when the grenadier
awoke<br>
 them. In vain did Monsieur de Sucy endeavor to find the swathe
cut by<br>
 the rear-guard through the mass of human beings; it was
already<br>
 obliterated, like the wake of a vessel through the sea. They
could<br>
 only creep along, being often stopped by soldiers who threatened
to<br>
 kill their horses.</p>

<p><br>
 "Do you want to reach the bridge?" said the grenadier.</p>

<p>"At the cost of my life--at the cost of the whole world!"</p>

<p>"Then forward, march! you can't make omelets without breaking
eggs."</p>

<p>And the grenadier of the guard urged the horses over men and
bivouacs<br>
 with bloody wheels and a double line of corpses on either side
of<br>
 them. We must do him the justice to say that he never spared
his<br>
 breath in shouting in stentorian tones,--</p>

<p>"Look out there, carrion!"</p>

<p>"Poor wretches!" cried the major.</p>

<p>"Pooh! that or the cold, that or the cannon," said the
grenadier,<br>
 prodding the horses, and urging them on.</p>

<p>A catastrophe, which might well have happened to them much
sooner, put<br>
 a stop to their advance. The carriage was overturned.</p>

<p>"I expected it," cried the imperturbable grenadier. "Ho! ho!
your man<br>
 is dead."</p>

<p>"Poor Laurent!" said the major.</p>

<p>"Laurent? Was he in the 5th chasseurs?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then he was my cousin. Oh, well, this dog's life isn't happy
enough<br>
 to waste any joy in grieving for him."</p>

<p>The carriage could not be raised; the horses were taken out
with<br>
 serious and, as it proved, irreparable loss of time. The shock
of the<br>
 overturn was so violent that the young countess, roused from
her<br>
 lethargy, threw off her coverings and rose.</p>

<p>"Philippe, where are we?" she cried in a gentle voice, looking
about<br>
 her.</p>

<p>"Only five hundred feet from the bridge. We are now going to
cross the<br>
 Beresina, Stephanie, and once across I will not torment you any
more;<br>
 you shall sleep; we shall be in safety, and can reach Wilna
easily.--<br>
 God grant that she may never know what her life has cost!" he
thought.</p>

<p>"Philippe! you are wounded!"</p>

<p>"That is nothing."</p>

<p>Too late! the fatal hour had come. The Russian cannon sounded
the<br>
 reveille. Masters of Studzianka, they could sweep the plain, and
by<br>
 daylight the major could see two of their columns moving and
forming<br>
 on the heights. A cry of alarm arose from the multitude, who
started<br>
 to their feet in an instant. Every man now understood his
danger<br>
 instinctively, and the whole mass rushed to gain the bridge with
the<br>
 motion of a wave.</p>

<p>The Russians came down with the rapidity of a conflagration.
Men,<br>
 women, children, horses,--all rushed tumultuously to the
bridge.<br>
 Fortunately the major, who was carrying the countess, was still
some<br>
 distance from it. General Eble had just set fire to the supports
on<br>
 the other bank. In spite of the warnings shouted to those who
were<br>
 rushing upon the bridge, not a soul went back. Not only did the
bridge<br>
 go down crowded with human beings, but the impetuosity of that
flood<br>
 of men toward the fatal bank was so furious that a mass of
humanity<br>
 poured itself violently into the river like an avalanche. Not a
cry<br>
 was heard; the only sound was like the dropping of monstrous
stones<br>
 into the water. Then the Beresina was a mass of floating
corpses.</p>

<p>The retrograde movement of those who now fell back into the
plain to<br>
 escape the death before them was so violent, and their
concussion<br>
 against those who were advancing from the rear so terrible,
that<br>
 numbers were smothered or trampled to death. The Comte and
Comtesse de<br>
 Vandieres owed their lives to their carriage, behind which
Philippe<br>
 forced them, using it as a breastwork. As for the major and
the<br>
 grenadier, they found their safety in their strength. They
killed to<br>
 escape being killed.</p>

<p>This hurricane of human beings, the flux and reflux of living
bodies,<br>
 had the effect of leaving for a few short moments the whole bank
of<br>
 the Beresina deserted. The multitude were surging to the plain.
If a<br>
 few men rushed to the river, it was less in the hope of reaching
the<br>
 other bank, which to them was France, than to rush from the
horrors of<br>
 Siberia. Despair proved an aegis to some bold hearts. One
officer<br>
 sprang from ice-cake to ice-cake, and reached the opposite
shore. A<br>
 soldier clambered miraculously over mounds of dead bodies and
heaps of<br>
 ice. The multitude finally comprehended that the Russians would
not<br>
 put to death a body of twenty thousand men, without arms,
torpid,<br>
 stupid, unable to defend themselves; and each man awaited his
fate<br>
 with horrible resignation. Then the major and the grenadier,
the<br>
 general and his wife, remained almost alone on the river bank, a
few<br>
 steps from the spot where the bridge had been. They stood there,
with<br>
 dry eyes, silent, surrounded by heaps of dead. A few sound
soldiers, a<br>
 few officers to whom the emergency had restored their natural
energy,<br>
 were near them. This group consisted of some fifty men in all.
The<br>
 major noticed at a distance of some two hundred yards the
remains of<br>
 another bridge intended for carriages and destroyed the day
before.</p>

<p>"Let us make a raft!" he cried.</p>

<p>He had hardly uttered the words before the whole group rushed
to the<br>
 ruins, and began to pick up iron bolts, and screws, and pieces
of wood<br>
 and ropes, whatever materials they could find that were suitable
for<br>
 the construction of a raft. A score of soldiers and officers,
who were<br>
 armed, formed a guard, commanded by the major, to protect the
workers<br>
 against the desperate attacks which might be expected from the
crowd,<br>
 if their scheme was discovered. The instinct of freedom, strong
in all<br>
 prisoners, inspiring them to miraculous acts, can only be
compared<br>
 with that which now drove to action these unfortunate
Frenchmen.</p>

<p>"The Russians! the Russians are coming!" cried the defenders
to the<br>
 workers; and the work went on, the raft increased in length
and<br>
 breadth and depth. Generals, soldiers, colonel, all put
their<br>
 shoulders to the wheel; it was a true image of the building of
Noah's<br>
 ark. The young countess, seated beside her husband, watched
the<br>
 progress of the work with regret that she could not help it; and
yet<br>
 she did assist in making knots to secure the cordage.</p>

<p>At last the raft was finished. Forty men launched it on the
river, a<br>
 dozen others holding the cords which moored it to the shore. But
no<br>
 sooner had the builders seen their handiwork afloat, than they
sprang<br>
 from the bank with odious selfishness. The major, fearing the
fury of<br>
 this first rush, held back the countess and the general, but too
late<br>
 he saw the whole raft covered, men pressing together like crowds
at a<br>
 theatre.</p>

<p>"Savages!" he cried, "it was I who gave you the idea of that
raft. I<br>
 have saved you, and you deny me a place."</p>

<p>A confused murmur answered him. The men at the edge of the
raft, armed<br>
 with long sticks, pressed with violence against the shore to
send off<br>
 the frail construction with sufficient impetus to force its
way<br>
 through corpses and ice-floes to the other shore.</p>

<p>"Thunder of heaven! I'll sweep you into the water if you don't
take<br>
 the major and his two companions," cried the stalwart grenadier,
who<br>
 swung his sabre, stopped the departure, and forced the men to
stand<br>
 closer in spite of furious outcries.</p>

<p>"I shall fall,"--"I am falling,"--"Push off! push
off!--Forward!"<br>
 resounded on all sides.</p>

<p>The major looked with haggard eyes at Stephanie, who lifted
hers to<br>
 heaven with a feeling of sublime resignation.</p>

<p>"To die with thee!" she said.</p>

<p>There was something even comical in the position of the men
in<br>
 possession of the raft. Though they were uttering awful groans
and<br>
 imprecations, they dared not resist the grenadier, for in truth
they<br>
 were so closely packed together, that a push to one man might
send<br>
 half of them overboard. This danger was so pressing that a
cavalry<br>
 captain endeavored to get rid of the grenadier; but the latter,
seeing<br>
 the hostile movement of the officer, seized him round the waist
and<br>
 flung him into the water, crying out,--</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! my duck, do you want to drink? Well, then, drink!--
Here are<br>
 two places," he cried. "Come, major, toss me the little woman
and<br>
 follow yourself. Leave that old fossil, who'll be dead by
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Make haste!" cried the voice of all, as one man.</p>

<p>"Come, major, they are grumbling, and they have a right to do
so."</p>

<p>The Comte de Vandieres threw off his wrappings and showed
himself in<br>
 his general's uniform.</p>

<p>"Let us save the count," said Philippe.</p>

<p>Stephanie pressed his hand, and throwing herself on his
breast, she<br>
 clasped him tightly.</p>

<p>"Adieu!" she said.</p>

<p>They had understood each other.</p>

<p>The Comte de Vandieres recovered sufficient strength and
presence of<br>
 mind to spring upon the raft, whither Stephanie followed him,
after<br>
 turning a last look to Philippe.</p>

<p>"Major! will you take my place? I don't care a fig for life,"
cried<br>
 the grenadier. "I've neither wife nor child nor mother."</p>

<p>"I confide them to your care," said the major, pointing to the
count<br>
 and his wife.</p>

<p>"Then be easy; I'll care for them, as though they were my very
eyes."</p>

<p>The raft was now sent off with so much violence toward the
opposite<br>
 side of the river, that as it touched ground, the shock was felt
by<br>
 all. The count, who was at the edge of it, lost his balance and
fell<br>
 into the river; as he fell, a cake of sharp ice caught him, and
cut<br>
 off his head, flinging it to a great distance.</p>

<p>"See there! major!" cried the grenadier.</p>

<p>"Adieu!" said a woman's voice.</p>

<p>Philippe de Sucy fell to the ground, overcome with horror and
fatigue.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE CURE</h3>

<p>"My poor niece became insane," continued the physician, after
a few<br>
 moment's silence. "Ah! monsieur," he said, seizing the marquis's
hand,<br>
 "life has been awful indeed for that poor little woman, so
young, so<br>
 delicate! After being, by dreadful fatality, separated from
the<br>
 grenadier, whose name was Fleuriot, she was dragged about for
two<br>
 years at the heels of the army, the plaything of a crowd of
wretches.<br>
 She was often, they tell me, barefooted, and scarcely clothed;
for<br>
 months together, she had no care, no food but what she could
pick up;<br>
 sometimes kept in hospitals, sometimes driven away like an
animal, God<br>
 alone knows the horrors that poor unfortunate creature has
survived.<br>
 She was locked up in a madhouse, in a little town in Germany, at
the<br>
 time her relatives, thinking her dead, divided her property. In
1816,<br>
 the grenadier Fleuriot was at an inn in Strasburg, where she
went<br>
 after making her escape from the madhouse. Several peasants told
the<br>
 grenadier that she had lived for a whole month in the forest,
where<br>
 they had tracked her in vain, trying to catch her, but she had
always<br>
 escaped them. I was then staying a few miles from Strasburg.
Hearing<br>
 much talk of a wild woman caught in the woods, I felt a desire
to<br>
 ascertain the truth of the ridiculous stories which were current
about<br>
 her. What were my feelings on beholding my own niece! Fleuriot
told me<br>
 all he knew of her dreadful history. I took the poor man with my
niece<br>
 back to my home in Auvergne, where, unfortunately, I lost him
some<br>
 months later. He had some slight control over Madame de
Vandieres; he<br>
 alone could induce her to wear clothing. 'Adieu,' that word,
which is<br>
 her only language, she seldom uttered at that time. Fleuriot
had<br>
 endeavored to awaken in her a few ideas, a few memories of the
past;<br>
 but he failed; all that he gained was to make her say that
melancholy<br>
 word a little oftener. Still, the grenadier knew how to amuse
her and<br>
 play with her; my hope was in him, but--"</p>

<p><br>
 He was silent for a moment.</p>

<p>"Here," he continued, "she has found another creature, with
whom she<br>
 seems to have some strange understanding. It is a poor
idiotic<br>
 peasant-girl, who, in spite of her ugliness and stupidity, loved
a<br>
 man, a mason. The mason was willing to marry her, as she had
some<br>
 property. Poor Genevieve was happy for a year; she dressed in
her best<br>
 to dance with her lover on Sunday; she comprehended love; in her
heart<br>
 and soul there was room for that one sentiment. But the mason,
Dallot,<br>
 reflected. He found a girl with all her senses, and more land
than<br>
 Genevieve, and he deserted the poor creature. Since then she has
lost<br>
 the little intellect that love developed in her; she can do
nothing<br>
 but watch the cows, or help at harvesting. My niece and this
poor girl<br>
 are friends, apparently by some invisible chain of their
common<br>
 destiny, by the sentiment in each which has caused their
madness.<br>
 See!" added Stephanie's uncle, leading the marquis to a
window.</p>

<p>The latter then saw the countess seated on the ground
between<br>
 Genevieve's legs. The peasant-girl, armed with a huge horn comb,
was<br>
 giving her whole attention to the work of disentangling the long
black<br>
 hair of the poor countess, who was uttering little stifled
cries,<br>
 expressive of some instinctive sense of pleasure. Monsieur
d'Albon<br>
 shuddered as he saw the utter abandonment of the body, the
careless<br>
 animal ease which revealed in the hapless woman a total absence
of<br>
 soul.</p>

<p>"Philippe, Philippe!" he muttered, "the past horrors are
nothing!--Is<br>
 there no hope?" he asked.</p>

<p>The old physician raised his eyes to heaven.</p>

<p>"Adieu, monsieur," said the marquis, pressing his hand. "My
friend is<br>
 expecting me. He will soon come to you."</p>

<p>"Then it was really she!" cried de Sucy at d'Albon's first
words. "Ah!<br>
 I still doubted it," he added, a few tears falling from his
eyes,<br>
 which were habitually stern.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is the Comtesse de Vandieres," replied the
marquis.</p>

<p>The colonel rose abruptly from his bed and began to dress.</p>

<p>"Philippe!" cried his friend, "are you mad?"</p>

<p>"I am no longer ill," replied the colonel, simply. "This news
has<br>
 quieted my suffering. What pain can I feel when I think of
Stephanie?<br>
 I am going to the Bons-Hommes, to see her, speak to her, cure
her. She<br>
 is free. Well, happiness will smile upon us--or Providence is
not in<br>
 this world. Think you that that poor woman could hear my voice
and not<br>
 recover reason?"</p>

<p>"She has already seen you and not recognized you," said his
friend,<br>
 gently, for he felt the danger of Philippe's excited hopes, and
tried<br>
 to cast a salutary doubt upon them.</p>

<p>The colonel quivered; then he smiled, and made a motion of<br>
 incredulity. No one dared to oppose his wish, and within a very
short<br>
 time he reached the old priory.</p>

<p>"Where is she?" he cried, on arriving.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said her uncle, "she is sleeping. See, here she
is."</p>

<p>Philippe then saw the poor insane creature lying on a bench in
the<br>
 sun. Her head was protected from the heat by a forest of hair
which<br>
 fell in tangled locks over her face. Her arms hung gracefully to
the<br>
 ground; her body lay easily posed like that of a doe; her feet
were<br>
 folded under her without effort; her bosom rose and fell at
regular<br>
 intervals; her skin, her complexion, had that porcelain
whiteness,<br>
 which we admire so much in the clear transparent faces of
children.<br>
 Standing motionless beside her, Genevieve held in her hand a
branch<br>
 which Stephanie had doubtless climbed a tall poplar to obtain,
and the<br>
 poor idiot was gently waving it above her sleeping companion, to
chase<br>
 away the flies and cool the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The peasant-woman gazed at Monsieur Fanjat and the colonel;
then, like<br>
 an animal which recognizes its master, she turned her head
slowly to<br>
 the countess, and continued to watch her, without giving any
sign of<br>
 surprise or intelligence. The air was stifling; the stone
bench<br>
 glittered in the sunlight; the meadow exhaled to heaven those
impish<br>
 vapors which dance and dart above the herbage like silvery dust;
but<br>
 Genevieve seemed not to feel this all-consuming heat.</p>

<p>The colonel pressed the hand of the doctor violently in his
own. Tears<br>
 rolled from his eyes along his manly cheeks, and fell to the
earth at<br>
 the feet of his Stephanie.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said the uncle, "for two years past, my heart is
broken<br>
 day by day. Soon you will be like me. You may not always weep,
but you<br>
 will always feel your sorrow."</p>

<p>The two men understood each other; and again, pressing each
other's<br>
 hands, they remained motionless, contemplating the exquisite
calmness<br>
 which sleep had cast upon that graceful creature. From time to
time<br>
 she gave a sigh, and that sigh, which had all the semblance
of<br>
 sensibilities, made the unhappy colonel tremble with hope.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said Monsieur Fanjat, "do not deceive yourself,
monsieur;<br>
 there is no meaning in her sigh."</p>

<p>Those who have ever watched for hours with delight the sleep
of one<br>
 who is tenderly beloved, whose eyes will smile to them at
waking, can<br>
 understand the sweet yet terrible emotion that shook the
colonel's<br>
 soul. To him, this sleep was an illusion; the waking might be
death,<br>
 death in its most awful form. Suddenly, a little goat jumped in
three<br>
 bounds to the bench, and smelt at Stephanie, who waked at the
sound.<br>
 She sprang to her feet, but so lightly that the movement did
not<br>
 frighten the freakish animal; then she caught sight of Philippe,
and<br>
 darted away, followed by her four-footed friend, to a hedge of
elders;<br>
 there she uttered the same little cry like a frightened bird,
which<br>
 the two men had heard near the other gate. Then she climbed an
acacia,<br>
 and nestling into its tufted top, she watched the stranger with
the<br>
 inquisitive attention of the forest birds.</p>

<p>"Adieu, adieu, adieu," she said, without the soul
communicating one<br>
 single intelligent inflexion to the word.</p>

<p>It was uttered impassively, as the bird sings his note.</p>

<p>"She does not recognize me!" cried the colonel, in
despair.<br>
 "Stephanie! it is Philippe, thy Philippe, PHILIPPE!"</p>

<p>And the poor soldier went to the acacia; but when he was a few
steps<br>
 from it, the countess looked at him, as if defying him, although
a<br>
 slight expression of fear seemed to flicker in her eye; then,
with a<br>
 single bound she sprang from the acacia to a laburnum, and
thence to a<br>
 Norway fir, where she darted from branch to branch with
extraordinary<br>
 agility.</p>

<p>"Do not pursue her," said Monsieur Fanjat to the colonel, "or
you will<br>
 arouse an aversion which might become insurmountable. I will
help you<br>
 to tame her and make her come to you. Let us sit on this bench.
If you<br>
 pay no attention to her, she will come of her own accord to
examine<br>
 you."</p>

<p>"SHE! not to know me! to flee me!" repeated the colonel,
seating<br>
 himself on a bench with his back to a tree that shaded it, and
letting<br>
 his head fall upon his breast.</p>

<p>The doctor said nothing. Presently, the countess came gently
down the<br>
 fir-tree, letting herself swing easily on the branches, as the
wind<br>
 swayed them. At each branch she stopped to examine the stranger;
but<br>
 seeing him motionless, she at last sprang to the ground and
came<br>
 slowly towards him across the grass. When she reached a tree
about ten<br>
 feet distant, against which she leaned, Monsieur Fanjat said to
the<br>
 colonel in a low voice,--</p>

<p>"Take out, adroitly, from my right hand pocket some lumps of
sugar you<br>
 will feel there. Show them to her, and she will come to us. I
will<br>
 renounce in your favor my sole means of giving her pleasure.
With<br>
 sugar, which she passionately loves, you will accustom her to
approach<br>
 you, and to know you again."</p>

<p>"When she was a woman," said Philippe, sadly, "she had no
taste for<br>
 sweet things."</p>

<p>When the colonel showed her the lump of sugar, holding it
between the<br>
 thumb and forefinger of his right hand, she again uttered her
little<br>
 wild cry, and sprang toward him; then she stopped, struggling
against<br>
 the instinctive fear he caused her; she looked at the sugar and
turned<br>
 away her head alternately, precisely like a dog whose master
forbids<br>
 him to touch his food until he has said a letter of the alphabet
which<br>
 he slowly repeats. At last the animal desire triumphed over
fear.<br>
 Stephanie darted to Philippe, cautiously putting out her little
brown<br>
 hand to seize the prize, touched the fingers of her poor lover
as she<br>
 snatched the sugar, and fled away among the trees. This dreadful
scene<br>
 overcame the colonel; he burst into tears and rushed into the
house.</p>

<p>"Has love less courage than friendship?" Monsieur Fanjat said
to him.<br>
 "I have some hope, Monsieur le baron. My poor niece was in a far
worse<br>
 state than that in which you now find her."</p>

<p>"How was that possible?" cried Philippe.</p>

<p>"She went naked," replied the doctor.</p>

<p>The colonel made a gesture of horror and turned pale. The
doctor saw<br>
 in that sudden pallor alarming symptoms; he felt the colonel's
pulse,<br>
 found him in a violent fever, and half persuaded, half compelled
him<br>
 to go to bed. Then he gave him a dose of opium to ensure a calm
sleep.</p>

<p>Eight days elapsed, during which Colonel de Sucy struggled
against<br>
 mortal agony; tears no longer came to his eyes. His soul,
often<br>
 lacerated, could not harden itself to the sight of
Stephanie's<br>
 insanity; but he covenanted, so to speak, with his cruel
situation,<br>
 and found some assuaging of his sorrow. He had the courage to
slowly<br>
 tame the countess by bringing her sweetmeats; he took such pains
in<br>
 choosing them, and he learned so well how to keep the little
conquests<br>
 he sought to make upon her instincts--that last shred of her
intellect<br>
 --that he ended by making her much TAMER than she had ever
been.</p>

<p>Every morning he went into the park, and if, after searching
for her<br>
 long, he could not discover on what tree she was swaying, nor
the<br>
 covert in which she crouched to play with a bird, nor the roof
on<br>
 which she might have clambered, he would whistle the well-known
air of<br>
 "Partant pour la Syrie," to which some tender memory of their
love<br>
 attached. Instantly, Stephanie would run to him with the
lightness of<br>
 a fawn. She was now so accustomed to see him, that he frightened
her<br>
 no longer. Soon she was willing to sit upon his knee, and clasp
him<br>
 closely with her thin and agile arm. In that attitude--so dear
to<br>
 lovers!--Philippe would feed her with sugarplums. Then, having
eaten<br>
 those that he gave her, she would often search his pockets
with<br>
 gestures that had all the mechanical velocity of a monkey's
motions.<br>
 When she was very sure there was nothing more, she looked at
Philippe<br>
 with clear eyes, without ideas, with recognition. Then she would
play<br>
 with him, trying at times to take off his boots to see his
feet,<br>
 tearing his gloves, putting on his hat; she would even let him
pass<br>
 his hands through her hair, and take her in his arms; she
accepted,<br>
 but without pleasure, his ardent kisses. She would look at
him<br>
 silently, without emotion, when his tears flowed; but she
always<br>
 understood his "Partant pour la Syrie," when he whistled it,
though he<br>
 never succeeded in teaching her to say her own name
Stephanie.</p>

<p>Philippe was sustained in his agonizing enterprise by hope,
which<br>
 never abandoned him. When, on fine autumn mornings, he found
the<br>
 countess sitting peacefully on a bench, beneath a poplar now<br>
 yellowing, the poor lover would sit at her feet, looking into
her eyes<br>
 as long as she would let him, hoping ever that the light that
was in<br>
 them would become intelligent. Sometimes the thought deluded him
that<br>
 he saw those hard immovable rays softening, vibrating, living,
and he<br>
 cried out,--</p>

<p>"Stephanie! Stephanie! thou hearest me, thou seest me!"</p>

<p>But she listened to that cry as to a noise, the soughing of
the wind<br>
 in the tree-tops, or the lowing of the cow on the back of which
she<br>
 climbed. Then the colonel would wring his hands in
despair,--despair<br>
 that was new each day.</p>

<p>One evening, under a calm sky, amid the silence and peace of
that<br>
 rural haven, the doctor saw, from a distance, that the colonel
was<br>
 loading his pistols. The old man felt then that the young man
had<br>
 ceased to hope; he felt the blood rushing to his heart, and if
he<br>
 conquered the vertigo that threatened him, it was because he
would<br>
 rather see his niece living and mad than dead. He hastened
up.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" he said.</p>

<p>"That is for me," replied the colonel, pointing to a pistol
already<br>
 loaded, which was lying on the bench; "and this is for her," he
added,<br>
 as he forced the wad into the weapon he held.</p>

<p>The countess was lying on the ground beside him, playing with
the<br>
 balls.</p>

<p>"Then you do not know," said the doctor, coldly, concealing
his<br>
 terror, "that in her sleep last night she called you:
Philippe!"</p>

<p>"She called me!" cried the baron, dropping his pistol, which
Stephanie<br>
 picked up. He took it from her hastily, caught up the one that
was on<br>
 the bench, and rushed away.</p>

<p>"Poor darling!" said the doctor, happy in the success of his
lie. He<br>
 pressed the poor creature to his breast, and continued speaking
to<br>
 himself: "He would have killed thee, selfish man! because he
suffers.<br>
 He does not love thee for thyself, my child! But we forgive, do
we<br>
 not? He is mad, out of his senses, but thou art only senseless.
No,<br>
 God alone should call thee to Him. We think thee unhappy, we
pity thee<br>
 because thou canst not share our sorrows, fools that we
are!--But," he<br>
 said, sitting down and taking her on his knee, "nothing troubles
thee;<br>
 thy life is like that of a bird, of a fawn--"</p>

<p>As he spoke she darted upon a young blackbird which was
hopping near<br>
 them, caught it with a little note of satisfaction, strangled
it,<br>
 looked at it, dead in her hand, and flung it down at the foot of
a<br>
 tree without a thought.</p>

<p>The next day, as soon as it was light, the colonel came down
into the<br>
 gardens, and looked about for Stephanie,--he believed in the
coming<br>
 happiness. Not finding her he whistled. When his darling came to
him,<br>
 he took her on his arm; they walked together thus for the first
time,<br>
 and he led her within a group of trees, the autumn foliage of
which<br>
 was dropping to the breeze. The colonel sat down. Of her own
accord<br>
 Stephanie placed herself on his knee. Philippe trembled with
joy.</p>

<p>"Love," he said, kissing her hands passionately, "I am
Philippe."</p>

<p>She looked at him with curiosity.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, pressing her to him, "dost thou feel my
heart? It has<br>
 beaten for thee alone. I love thee ever. Philippe is not dead;
he is<br>
 not dead, thou art on him, in his arms. Thou art MY Stephanie; I
am<br>
 thy Philippe."</p>

<p>"Adieu," she said, "adieu."</p>

<p>The colonel quivered, for he fancied he saw his own
excitement<br>
 communicated to his mistress. His heart-rending cry, drawn from
him by<br>
 despair, that last effort of an eternal love, of a delirious
passion,<br>
 was successful, the mind of his darling was awaking.</p>

<p>"Ah! Stephanie! Stephanie! we shall yet be happy."</p>

<p>She gave a cry of satisfaction, and her eyes brightened with a
flash<br>
 of vague intelligence.</p>

<p>"She knows me!--Stephanie!"</p>

<p>His heart swelled; his eyelids were wet with tears. Then,
suddenly,<br>
 the countess showed him a bit of sugar she had found in his
pocket<br>
 while he was speaking to her. He had mistaken for human thought
the<br>
 amount of reason required for a monkey's trick. Philippe dropped
to<br>
 the ground unconscious. Monsieur Fanjat found the countess
sitting on<br>
 the colonel's body. She was biting her sugar, and testifying
her<br>
 pleasure by pretty gestures and affectations with which, had she
her<br>
 reason, she might have imitated her parrot or her cat.</p>

<p>"Ah! my friend," said Philippe, when he came to his senses, "I
die<br>
 every day, every moment! I love too well! I could still bear
all, if,<br>
 in her madness, she had kept her woman's nature. But to see her
always<br>
 a savage, devoid even of modesty, to see her--"</p>

<p>"You want opera madness, do you? something picturesque and
pleasing,"<br>
 said the doctor, bitterly. "Your love and your devotion yield
before a<br>
 prejudice. Monsieur, I have deprived myself for your sake of the
sad<br>
 happiness of watching over my niece; I have left to you the
pleasure<br>
 of playing with her; I have kept for myself the heaviest cares.
While<br>
 you have slept, I have watched, I have-- Go, monsieur, go!
abandon<br>
 her! leave this sad refuge. I know how to live with that dear
darling<br>
 creature; I comprehend her madness, I watch her gestures, I know
her<br>
 secrets. Some day you will thank me for thus sending you
away."</p>

<p>The colonel left the old monastery, never to return but once.
The<br>
 doctor was horrified when he saw the effect he had produced upon
his<br>
 guest, whom he now began to love when he saw him thus. Surely,
if<br>
 either of the two lovers were worthy of pity, it was Philippe;
did he<br>
 not bear alone the burden of their dreadful sorrow?</p>

<p>After the colonel's departure the doctor kept himself informed
about<br>
 him; he learned that the miserable man was living on an estate
near<br>
 Saint-Germain. In truth, the baron, on the faith of a dream,
had<br>
 formed a project which he believed would yet restore the mind of
his<br>
 darling. Unknown to the doctor, he spent the rest of the autumn
in<br>
 preparing for his enterprise. A little river flowed through his
park<br>
 and inundated during the winter the marshes on either side of
it,<br>
 giving it some resemblance to the Beresina. The village of
Satout, on<br>
 the heights above, closed in, like Studzianka, the scene of
horror.<br>
 The colonel collected workmen to deepen the banks, and by the
help of<br>
 his memory, he copied in his park the shore where General
Eble<br>
 destroyed the bridge. He planted piles, and made buttresses and
burned<br>
 them, leaving their charred and blackened ruins, standing in the
water<br>
 from shore to shore. Then he gathered fragments of all kinds,
like<br>
 those of which the raft was built. He ordered dilapidated
uniforms and<br>
 clothing of every grade, and hired hundreds of peasants to wear
them;<br>
 he erected huts and cabins for the purpose of burning them. In
short,<br>
 he forgot nothing that might recall that most awful of all
scenes, and<br>
 he succeeded.</p>

<p>Toward the last of December, when the snow had covered with
its thick,<br>
 white mantle all his imitative preparations, he recognized
the<br>
 Beresina. This false Russia was so terribly truthful, that
several of<br>
 his army comrades recognized the scene of their past misery at
once.<br>
 Monsieur de Sucy took care to keep secret the motive for this
tragic<br>
 imitation, which was talked of in several Parisian circles as a
proof<br>
 of insanity.</p>

<p>Early in January, 1820, the colonel drove in a carriage, the
very<br>
 counterpart of the one in which he had driven the Comte and
Comtesse<br>
 de Vandieres from Moscow to Studzianka. The horses, too, were
like<br>
 those he had gone, at the peril of his life, to fetch from the
Russian<br>
 outposts. He himself wore the soiled fantastic clothing, the
same<br>
 weapons, as on the 29th of November, 1812. He had let his beard
grow,<br>
 also his hair, which was tangled and matted, and his face
was<br>
 neglected, so that nothing might be wanting to represent the
awful<br>
 truth.</p>

<p>"I can guess your purpose," cried Monsieur Fanjat, when he saw
the<br>
 colonel getting out of the carriage. "If you want to succeed, do
not<br>
 let my niece see you in that equipage. To-night I will give her
opium.<br>
 During her sleep, we will dress her as she was at Studzianka,
and<br>
 place her in the carriage. I will follow you in another
vehicle."</p>

<p>About two in the morning, the sleeping countess was placed in
the<br>
 carriage and wrapped in heavy coverings. A few peasants with
torches<br>
 lighted up this strange abduction. Suddenly, a piercing cry
broke the<br>
 silence of the night. Philippe and the doctor turned, and
saw<br>
 Genevieve coming half-naked from the ground-floor room in which
she<br>
 slept.</p>

<p>"Adieu, adieu! all is over, adieu!" she cried, weeping hot
tears.</p>

<p>"Genevieve, what troubles you?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>Genevieve shook her head with a motion of despair, raised her
arm to<br>
 heaven, looked at the carriage, uttering a long-drawn moan with
every<br>
 sign of the utmost terror; then she returned to her room
silently.</p>

<p>"That is a good omen!" cried the colonel. "She feels she is to
lose<br>
 her companion. Perhaps she SEES that Stephanie will recover
her<br>
 reason."</p>

<p>"God grant it!" said Monsieur Fanjat, who himself was affected
by the<br>
 incident.</p>

<p>Ever since he had made a close study of insanity, the good man
had met<br>
 with many examples of the prophetic faculty and the gift of
second<br>
 sight, proofs of which are frequently given by alienated minds,
and<br>
 which may also be found, so travellers say, among certain tribes
of<br>
 savages.</p>

<p>As the colonel had calculated, Stephanie crossed the
fictitious plain<br>
 of the Beresina at nine o'clock in the morning, when she was
awakened<br>
 by a cannon shot not a hundred yards from the spot where the<br>
 experiment was to be tried. This was a signal. Hundreds of
peasants<br>
 made a frightful clamor like that on the shore of the river
that<br>
 memorable night, when twenty thousand stragglers were doomed to
death<br>
 or slavery by their own folly.</p>

<p>At the cry, at the shot, the countess sprang from the
carriage, and<br>
 ran, with delirious emotion, over the snow to the banks of the
river;<br>
 she saw the burned bivouacs and the charred remains of the
bridge, and<br>
 the fatal raft, which the men were launching into the icy waters
of<br>
 the Beresina. The major, Philippe, was there, striking back the
crowd<br>
 with his sabre. Madame de Vandieres gave a cry, which went to
all<br>
 hearts, and threw herself before the colonel, whose heart beat
wildly.<br>
 She seemed to gather herself together, and, at first, looked
vaguely<br>
 at the singular scene. For an instant, as rapid as the
lightning's<br>
 flash, her eyes had that lucidity, devoid of mind, which we
admire in<br>
 the eye of birds; then passing her hand across her brow with the
keen<br>
 expression of one who meditates, she contemplated the living
memory of<br>
 a past scene spread before her, and, turning quickly to
Philippe, she<br>
 SAW HIM. An awful silence reigned in the crowd. The colonel
gasped,<br>
 but dared not speak; the doctor wept. Stephanie's sweet face
colored<br>
 faintly; then, from tint to tint, it returned to the brightness
of<br>
 youth, till it glowed with a beautiful crimson. Life and
happiness,<br>
 lighted by intelligence, came nearer and nearer like a
conflagration.<br>
 Convulsive trembling rose from her feet to her heart. Then
these<br>
 phenomena seemed to blend in one as Stephanie's eyes cast forth
a<br>
 celestial ray, the flame of a living soul. She lived, she
thought! She<br>
 shuddered, with fear perhaps, for God himself unloosed that
silent<br>
 tongue, and cast anew His fires into that long-extinguished
soul.<br>
 Human will came with its full electric torrent, and vivified the
body<br>
 from which it had been driven.</p>

<p>"Stephanie!" cried the colonel.</p>

<p>"Oh! it is Philippe," said the poor countess.</p>

<p>She threw herself into the trembling arms that the colonel
held out to<br>
 her, and the clasp of the lovers frightened the spectators.
Stephanie<br>
 burst into tears. Suddenly her tears stopped, she stiffened as
though<br>
 the lightning had touched her, and said in a feeble voice,--</p>

<p>"Adieu, Philippe; I love thee, adieu!"</p>

<p>"Oh! she is dead," cried the colonel, opening his arms.</p>

<p>The old doctor received the inanimate body of his niece,
kissed it as<br>
 though he were a young man, and carrying it aside, sat down with
it<br>
 still in his arms on a pile of wood. He looked at the countess
and<br>
 placed his feeble trembling hand upon her heart. That heart no
longer<br>
 beat.</p>

<p>"It is true," he said, looking up at the colonel, who
stood<br>
 motionless, and then at Stephanie, on whom death was placing
that<br>
 resplendent beauty, that fugitive halo, which is, perhaps, a
pledge of<br>
 the glorious future--"Yes, she is dead."</p>

<p>"Ah! that smile," cried Philippe, "do you see that smile? Can
it be<br>
 true?"</p>

<p>"She is turning cold," replied Monsieur Fanjat.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Sucy made a few steps to tear himself away from
the sight;<br>
 but he stopped, whistled the air that Stephanie had known, and
when<br>
 she did not come to him, went on with staggering steps like a
drunken<br>
 man, still whistling, but never turning back.</p>

<p>General Philippe de Sucy was thought in the social world to be
a very<br>
 agreeable man, and above all a very gay one. A few days ago, a
lady<br>
 complimented him on his good humor, and the charming equability
of his<br>
 nature.</p>

<p>"Ah! madame," he said, "I pay dear for my liveliness in my
lonely<br>
 evenings."</p>

<p>"Are you ever alone?" she said.</p>

<p>"No," he replied smiling.</p>

<p>If a judicious observer of human nature could have seen at
that moment<br>
 the expression on the Comte de Sucy's face, he would perhaps
have<br>
 shuddered.</p>

<p>"Why don't you marry?" said the lady, who had several
daughters at<br>
 school. "You are rich, titled, and of ancient lineage; you
have<br>
 talents, and a great future before you; all things smile upon
you."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "but a smile kills me."</p>

<p>The next day the lady heard with great astonishment that
Monsieur de<br>
 Sucy had blown his brains out during the night. The upper ranks
of<br>
 society talked in various ways over this extraordinary event,
and each<br>
 person looked for the cause of it. According to the proclivities
of<br>
 each reasoner, play, love, ambition, hidden disorders, and
vices,<br>
 explained the catastrophe, the last scene of a drama begun in
1812.<br>
 Two men alone, a marquis and former deputy, and an aged
physician,<br>
 knew that Philippe de Sucy was one of those strong men to whom
God has<br>
 given the unhappy power of issuing daily in triumph from awful
combats<br>
 which they fight with an unseen monster. If, for a moment,
God<br>
 withdraws from such men His all-powerful hand, they succumb.</p>

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

We have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones
that have responded.

As the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list
will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
